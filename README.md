# AI-generate-peronalized-Proposals
The world is changing and we believe AI Agents are going to play a big role in where we’re going next. We’re looking for someone who’s interested in walking with us as we move confidently into the future.

The vision
We want to work toward building an AI Agent platform for churches. We’ll start by offering a few key AI agents that every church needs, and will expand from there.

Churches will be able to use these AI Agents and eventually will be able to build their own.

Quick note: We're not looking for someone who can only build simple chatbots. Instead, we're looking for someone to build multi-level bots that work together to accomplish complex tasks.

Job Requirements
We understand that this is a developing technology and the successful candidate may have never built an AI agent before. However, they know what it takes to build AI agents and are excited to help us develop our AI agents.

We’re looking for someone who:
- Has a clear understanding of how to help fine-tuned llms work together to accomplish a complex task.
- Has a deep understanding of llms and how to use them within systems.
- Understands RAG and other methods to fine-tune llms.
- Ideally, we’d love someone who understands .net, but that’s not essential.
- Has a deep understanding of api’s and how to utilize them within systems.
- Is open to helping churches.
- Experience in AI/ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.
- Strong understanding of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and libraries like Hugging Face, OpenAI GPT, or spaCy.
- Familiarity with AI agents and their underlying technologies (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems, virtual assistants).

As we built this platform, there’s a chance this could turn into a long-term gig- if that’s something the successful candidate would be interested in.
=============
AI-powered application that generates personalized proposals based on parameters like employee rates, development types, and project durations, here's an outline of the steps you can follow in Python:
Step-by-Step Guide:

    Install Dependencies: Install the necessary libraries for the application, like Flask for the web app, Pandas for data handling, Scikit-learn for machine learning models, and NumPy for numerical operations.

pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn numpy

Create a Proposal Generator Model: Design a machine learning model or a rule-based system to calculate proposals based on the input data. For simplicity, let’s assume you will use a rule-based approach, which can be improved later.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def calculate_proposal(employee_rate, development_type, project_duration):
    """
    Calculate the proposal cost based on parameters.
    """
    base_rate = 50  # base rate per hour (example)
    dev_type_multiplier = {'basic': 1, 'advanced': 1.5, 'premium': 2}
    
    # Get multiplier based on development type
    multiplier = dev_type_multiplier.get(development_type.lower(), 1)
    
    # Calculate total proposal cost
    total_cost = employee_rate * base_rate * project_duration * multiplier
    return total_cost

# Example usage
proposal = calculate_proposal(100, 'advanced', 30)
print(f"Total Proposal Cost: ${proposal}")

Build a Flask API: Build a basic Flask web app to allow users to input parameters and get the generated proposal.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/generate_proposal', methods=['POST'])
def generate_proposal():
    data = request.json
    employee_rate = data['employee_rate']
    development_type = data['development_type']
    project_duration = data['project_duration']

    proposal = calculate_proposal(employee_rate, development_type, project_duration)
    
    return jsonify({'proposal_cost': proposal})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Integrate a Frontend Interface: If you want a basic front-end for input, you can create a simple HTML form that posts data to the API.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Proposal Generator</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Generate Proposal</h1>
    <form id="proposalForm">
        Employee Rate: <input type="text" id="employee_rate"><br><br>
        Development Type: <input type="text" id="development_type"><br><br>
        Project Duration (in days): <input type="text" id="project_duration"><br><br>
        <button type="submit">Generate Proposal</button>
    </form>
    <h2>Proposal Cost: <span id="proposalCost">---</span></h2>

    <script>
        document.getElementById('proposalForm').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();

            const employeeRate = document.getElementById('employee_rate').value;
            const developmentType = document.getElementById('development_type').value;
            const projectDuration = document.getElementById('project_duration').value;

            fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate_proposal', {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    employee_rate: employeeRate,
                    development_type: developmentType,
                    project_duration: projectDuration
                })
            })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => {
                document.getElementById('proposalCost').textContent = '$' + data.proposal_cost;
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>

Run the Application: Start the Flask app and open the HTML form in a browser. The form will submit data to the backend and display the proposal cost.

    python app.py

This is a basic prototype to get you started. You can expand this system by integrating machine learning models or rule-based systems to refine the proposal generation logic based on more detailed input. You may also add advanced features such as user authentication or a database to store the generated proposals for future analysis
